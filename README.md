<p> Because of the massive rise in the use of digital payment systems for transferring money, the risk of fraud transitions has also increased. Here in this project, I have done extensive research on identifying fraud transactions using machine learning algorithms. </p>

<h2>Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>   
<h3>Random Forest Classifier</h3>
<p>
A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. It is basically a set of decision trees from a randomly selected subset of the training set and then It collects the votes from different decision trees to decide the final prediction. In the random forest classifier, we got the test accuracy of 84.150124%.

<h3>Decision Tree Classifier</h3>
<p>
The decision tree classifier is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome. In this algorithm, there are two nodes, which are the decision node and the leaf node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. In the decision tree classifier, we got the test accuracy of 84.150124%.
